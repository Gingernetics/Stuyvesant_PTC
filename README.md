##What this is
The Stuyvesant PTC website was built out of a desire to improve the process by which ~3000 parents meet with their children's teachers over the course of two days. Rather than assigning time slots, this website informs parents about where they are in any particular queue, so that they can more efficiently plan their schedule traversing a 10-story building.

It is the hope of the creator that future years of StuyCS students are able to improve the website and make it in part their own.

Although one person did code the entirety of the project (yours truly), there existed a community of individuals within the class of 2018 who put in a lot of time and energy to make the site what it is.

If you are interested in interacting with the website on a deeper level, I would direct you to the (admittedly incomplete) [wiki page](https://github.com/Gingernetics/Stuyvesant_PTC/wiki).

##Who we are

### Ryan Siu 
(https://github.com/siuryan)

Ryan did the work that made this project feasible, including communicating to the parents the new system, organizing the ARISTA Executive Council and reserving the auditorium for the presentation. Ryan is a dilligent leader and I hope we have the opportunity to work together again in the future.

### Jen Yu 
(https://github.com/jenyu7)

Jen, alongside Ryan, helped iron out tthe design and purpose of the site months before serious coding began. I am also told that Jen helped garner support for the project amung the Computer Science faculty, which in turn greatly enhanced the project's legitimacy when presenting to administration.

### Shannon Lau 
(https://github.com/slau8)

Shannon is more or less solely responcible for the user interface, after highlighting problems and errors in the initial design that I had been blind to.

### Henry Zhang 
(https://github.com/henryz2000)

Henry helped out with the colors, the UX, the backend, and overall was a good frind throughout the process. It was good to have someone to talk to while debugging.

### Shruthi Venkata 
(https://github.com/shruthi00)

Shruthi played a large part in creating and choosing between color palettes. The scheme and aesthetic design of the site can also in part be attributed to her.

### Arif Roktim
(https://github.com/ArifRoktim)
  
Arif is a *UNIX wizard who modified the server environment to fix the strange permission errors I was comming across.  

### Gilvir Gill
(https://github.com/Gillgamesh)

Gilvir worked with me to determine the server resources the site would need to handle the many requests that would come in a short time span.

### Sammantha Ngo 
(https://github.com/sngo1)

I am indebted to Sammantha for describing to me in great detail the poor design and overall flaws that every iteration of the site seemed to come with (the most current variation is "acceptable"). Without an honest voice, those bad ideas might have made their way into production.

### Rodda John
(https://github.com/roddajohn)

Rodda served as the inspiration for this project, having created the ARISTA website just a year before to serve the Stuyvesant community. 

### Tina Wong
(https://github.com/tinawong15)

Tina became the original apprentice to this opperation and I'm grateful I was able to act as mentor and laugh with her over silly mistakes.

### Mr. Dyrland-Weaver, Mr. Konstantinovich, and Mr. Brown Mykolyk

Thank you for the improvements suggested, the advice, and the support provided.

Thank you to Mr. Eric Contreras (former principal) and the school board of directors for green-lighting this student-run project for live use in a DOE event, and for continuing to support the creative spirit that embodies Stuyvesant High School.

And of course, my gratitude goes toward the beta-testers, who during the weeks leading up to the event spent their afternoons helping us test and refine the site (ARISTA credits can be a powerful motivator).
